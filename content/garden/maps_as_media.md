title: "Maps as media and counter-data platform"
date: "2024-12-09"
summary: "This is an assignment that I wrote as a part of masters work with a 1000 word limitation. As a part of the assignment, I explore how maps can be proposed as media and data in the maps as counter-data to mass media and the impact it can have on communities."

**Title:** In this paper, I demonstrate how combining Marten’s and Jeppesen’s concept of Maps as counter-data media can be seen in the digital humanities project “Dehi Violence 2020 Archives.

Mattern (2015) characterizes maps as more than mere landscapes they represent to be simply
texts to be read, rather as rhetorical and political. Mattern (2015) highlights that by looking at the
“medial” properties of maps, we can better understand how they convey meaning, exert
influence, and carry bias. Bill Rankin, through his Radical Cartography project, calls attention to
those protocols and conventions by juxtaposing data sets, or rendering the same set of data in
varying styles, thus “provoking slippages, overlaps, and multiple kinds of diversity” (Mattern
2015).Mattern (2015) argues that maps as media are distributed among myriad “users” in
particular ways; they’re accessed, “processed” (do we still “read” maps?), and interpreted by
those users in different ways. Mattern (2015) questions the very existence and values of large
scale media-production industry with the critical question of who historically has owned the
means of describing the space, and what has been their interests? Recognizing maps as media
potentially opens up a more expansive understanding of how they operate (Mattern 2015).


Jeppesen and Sartoretto (2023) defines hegemonic maps as “visual representations produced
by dominant institutions that often reflect Western frameworks and can have a negative impact
on public discourse and social justice initiatives”. One example is the Johns Hopkins
Coronavirus Research Center global map, which uses a colour scheme of red, orange, and
green against a black background to represent the daily progression of the pandemic (Jeppesen
and Sartoretto 2023). This map, while widely circulated, relies on data that may be non-
comparable across countries due to variations in reporting criteria and timeframes (Jeppesen
and Sartoretto 2023). Countering the data narratives of hegemonic maps, community‐produced
maps can resist dominant representations of the pandemic, providing greater visibility,
specificity, and nuance regarding the communities and territories mapped (Jeppesen and
Sartoretto. 2023). Conjoining data and mapping, we define counter‐data mapping as practices
that integrate resistant data appropriations into counter‐mapping processes, with the objective
of challenging power asymmetries (Jeppesen and Sartoretto 2023).


“Delhi Violence 2020” is a community archive that documented communal violence and the
subsequent events that erupted as an outcome of citizenship policies introduced by the Indian
state. The archive brings together events from social media, news reports, and fact-finding
reports to show the rampant misinformation circulated around the events, organized and
targeted hate and violence by Hindu and right-wing groups, and complicity and inaction by the
police (DV2020). The aim of this archive is to provide a counter-narrative to the State's version
which holds anti-CAA activists responsible for instigating the violence, elides over the role of the
organized Hindutva forces including within the police and political establishment and projects
the violence as largely caused by the Muslim community (DV2020). The archive also contains a
timeline for incidents of violence, including counter data narratives from community
documented sources. This essay will explore “Delhi Violence 2020” archive at the intersection
of maps as media and as an implementation of counter-data mapping.


Regarding maps as media encourages us to recognize their prevalence and value as a
fundamental cultural form – but it also prompts us to supplement geography’s methodologies
and critical frameworks with those from media studies(Mattern 2015). The archive meticulously
documented numerous sub-incidents over a temporal plane, organizing them chronological
and categorizing them to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the socio-political
consequences. Mattern (2015) summarizes that maps inform, persuade or perhaps even
manipulate us, validate or marginalize voices, embody our ways of knowing and relating, shape
politics, shepherd or exploit our environment. Maps have always been, but are now more than
ever, media (Mattern 2015).


Jeppesen and Sartoretto (2023) find that marginalised communities have been resisting state
and commercial control of big data through resistant data appropriation and
counter‐hegemonic cartographic representations. The DV2020 archive seeks to challenge and
counteract the effects of state propaganda by providing an alternative narrative and perspective
on various issues. Such repositories of resistance link counter‐mapping to social movement
actions, further supporting our argument that counter-data mapping is the new frontier of
media activism and community communication (Jeppesen and Sartoretto 2023).
Counter‐mapping practices have revealed invisibilised, racialised, gendered, and Indigenous
communities, linking lived space to marginalised identities, and consequently have challenged
hegemonic maps that construct feelings of alarm, alienation, and social control (Jeppesen and
Sartoretto 2023).


Resistant data appropriation includes the construction of subaltern datasets and the
repurposing of big data for socio‐political resistance, a community communication practice
that both uses and contests new data technologies (Jeppesen and Sartoretto 2023). The
DV2020 archive has carefully curated its media sources from community members from various
news and social media platforms, showcasing resistant data-mapping practices. Activists have
re‐appropriated big data and created counter‐datasets to develop counter‐mapping
visualisations (Jeppesen and Sartoretto 2023). Jeppesen and Sartoretto (2023) argue that
counter‐data mapping is the new frontier of media activism and community communication,
with the potential to become an important communicative form of resistance in the 21st
century.


Despite whatever opportunities we might have to detour, or subvert, the map and its underlying
database – to build self-reflexive critiques of the cartographic enterprise right into the map itself – we sometimes run up against the operative or epistemological limitations of these systems
(Mattern 2015). The DV2020 model was capable of effectively illustrating the consequences of a
specific incident. Nevertheless, the inquiry interrogates the fundamental epistemological
question: whether every incident can be counter-documented, or scenarios where there are
multiple counter-data mappings. It is worth considering whether these counter-narratives
themselves have a significant social impact. Sometimes it’s simply impossible to pin things
down as a cartographic point, line, or area (Mattern 2015). Not everything is mappable, and not
everything belongs on a map (Mattern 2015).  


Maps can serve as a powerful medium for community communication, intersecting with
counter-hegemonic maps, resistant-data or counter-data mapping. Showcasing “Delhi
Violence 2020” archive as an example, we highlight that collective data appropriation by
marginalised communities embodies the potential for challenging dominant narratives and
fostering inclusive perspectives.
