After a couple of years staying in the FOSS movement, one of the most important questions that has always come up is "How to be a non-technical contributor to FOSS ?"

Lets understand and breakdown this question.

### Non-Technical contributor

A non-technical contributor is someone who is wanting to contribute to the [FOSS](https://voidspace.xyz/garden/why-do-free-software/) ecosystem, but instead of doing code based contributions, contributes in other forms. Ex : Mapping, Documentation, Evagalism, Events etc.

In this note, we will explore one such form of non-technical contribution to the [FOSS](https://voidspace.xyz/garden/why-do-free-software/) ecosystem.


As the FOSS movement continues to gain momentum, it's essential to make it accessible to people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. It is important that free software is accessible even to your grandmother. Lets start asking simple questions ?

1. Is the interface of the app / software I am suggesting available in my local languages (Ex, Tamil or Kannada) ?
2. If it is available in a local language, is it complete ? Are the words properly named ?

These 2 simple questions, open a huge scope for FOSS contribution.

Lets explore the concepts of internationalization, localization, translation, and transiteration, and how they can help bridge the language gap in the non-technical aspects of FOSS.

#### Internationalization: Preparing for Global Reach

Internationalization is the process of designing software or content to be adaptable to different languages and cultures. This involves removing cultural and linguistic biases, ensuring date and time formats are flexible, and using Unicode characters to support various scripts ¹. For instance, a FOSS project can use internationalization to allow users to select their preferred language and formatting options.

But when we talk about making a software international, we are talking about a handful of languages like English, Russian, Chinese, German etc. The why is not really much about the language, but largely about ensuring support for various scehemes of languages and ensure unicode accessiblity. This is largely about a global reach. Without spending more time here, lets move on the core of the idea.

#### Localization: Tailoring Content for Local Audiences

Localization takes internationalization a step further by adapting content to specific regions or languages. This involves translating text, adjusting formats, and incorporating local customs and preferences. But lets ask the larger question ? Why should we really consider this ?

According to the [2011 language census](https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/42561), only 43% of the indian population speak Hindi. But please note, this does not necessarily mean read or write, but just speak. This is still not a metric to say I understand Hindi completely. But also this metric has grouped Hindi like languages also into this metric. You can read more about it here.

Now coming back to the context, lets ask simple questions ?

1. Is it ok, if something is just in Hindi ? What about the litereate

In the context of FOSS, localization can help create documentation, user interfaces, and marketing materials that resonate with users in Tamilnadu or Karnataka.

Translation: Conveying Meaning Across Languages

Translation is the process of converting text from one language to another. In FOSS, translation plays a crucial role in making documentation, user interfaces, and other content accessible to non-English speakers. For example, translating FOSS documentation into Tamil or Kannada can help users in these regions understand and contribute to projects.

Transliteration: Representing Scripts in Alternative Formats

Transliteration involves representing text from one script in another script. This is useful when users need to input text in a language that doesn't have a native keyboard layout. In FOSS, transliteration can facilitate user interaction, especially in regions where multiple scripts are used.

Why These Concepts Matter in FOSS

By embracing internationalization, localization, translation, and transliteration, the FOSS movement can:

- Increase global participation and contributions
- Improve user experience for non-English speakers
- Enhance accessibility and inclusivity
- Foster a diverse and vibrant community

Conclusion

Breaking language barriers is essential for the growth and adoption of FOSS. By understanding and implementing internationalization, localization, translation, and transliteration, we can create a more inclusive and accessible community. Let's work together to make FOSS accessible to everyone, regardless of their linguistic or cultural background.
