Well the name is Ramaseshan.S but I go by the name VoidSpaceXYZ on the internet. My interest lies at the intersection of technology, history, culture, and commons.

But lets talk a little more. Yes, I am an tech dude, worked in the industry for 10 years. I started as a full stack developer, and fell in love with infrastructure, and shifted to the domains of DevOps, Systems Engineering. My last job role was a Lead DevOps Engineer from AVR EdGE Networks Pvt Ltd in Bangalore.

I wear multiple hats at work.I am **CloudOps**(Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform (OpenTofu), Ansible), **CostOps**(SBOM for Cloud, Cost Optimization, Kubecost), **DevOps**(Python, Java, NodeJS, CI/CD, Containerization like Docker), **ProductOps** (Architect products and dependencies and work closely in choosing a tech stack) and **SecurityOps** (SAST, security patching and VAPT). I also have a keen interest in policy and compliance and aware to a great extent on ISO27001, SOC2-Type2 (Controls) and GDPR. I have also **managed database** like PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, **cache systems** like Redis and **message queue** tools like RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Azure Queue. My experience with managed services like AKS, Application Gateway, WAF, Databases.


I have currently taken a break from work, and pursuing my masters in Digital Humanities and Culture at Trinity College Dublin. More about it [here](#).

Beyond technology, I love urban and terrace gardens. I have successfully grown veggies like tomatos, chillies, bell peppers, beans (french beans, kidney beans etc). Grown herbs like Roasemary, Lemon balm, thyme, mint, coriander to name a few. And with little success carrots and beets too.

I **still** strongly believe in the idea of Democracy, and actively take part in action that contributes positively towards empowering democracy. Specifically I am intested in hate speech, mis-information, fundamental rights, digital privacy and rights and anything else that will have a positive impact.

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) forms the core of my value system, you can read about it [here](/garden/why-do-free-software/). I volunteered with FSHM (Free Software Hardware Movement, Puducherry), FSFTN (Free Software Foundation, TamilNadu) and FSMK (Free Software Movement, Karnataka) for over 11 years. I took part in conferences, gave talks and lectures in colleges on the importance of FOSS, organized 4 to 7 day residential workshops to teach many free software tools.

I **used** to volunteer with Ambedkar Community Computing Center (AC3) for the past 7 years(2015-2023), but currently not participating actively since I live in Ireland.

I currently volunteer my time to [Janastu](https://janastu.org) in helping develop [PLASMA]() and offer technical support wherever possible.

Currently, my focus is on decentralized technology, community ownership of history and technology. I am working on a couple of projects and will soon post them. You can read more about them [here](/projects/)
