summary: "Will rats be liberated because of cats? Will goats and cocks be liberated because of foxes? Will the wealth of Indians increase because of the British? Will the non-Brahmins attain equality because of the Brahmins? If one thinks over these questions, one can realize the truth.


Even if liberation is somehow attained in these above cases, one firmly believe that women will never attain liberation because of men.


Women shouldn't forget the fact that the word 'masculinity' is itself internationally used in a manner demeaning to women. Women should remember that as long as 'masculinity' exists in the world, 'femininity' wouldn't be respected. As long as 'masculinity' exists in the world, the enslavement of women will keep increasing. Unless women destroy the concept of 'masculinity', it is certain that they will not attain liberation.
