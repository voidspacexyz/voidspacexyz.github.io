summary: "Though sex is considered a ‘dirty’ word in Indian society, the indispensable role it plays in our lives cannot be denied. The Toilet Seat takes a good look at how sex is perceived and portrayed in society, the social stigma attached to sex, especially the premarital and extramarital kind, and the perversions that suppression of sex can cause.


The book reflects upon the grey areas in relationships, the hypocrisy of people and the so-called values that bind people in a knot, redefines perceptions, and dispels myths with respect to love, sex and the female orgasm. It also gives valuable suggestions to improve relationships by understanding the sexual needs of partners and talking about them openly.


Well, what does the title of the book The Toilet Seat have to do with all this? Read on to find out"
